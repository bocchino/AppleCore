Things to check:

1. Uses of names must correspond to a declaration.

2. Every expression has a size and a signedness.  These must be
   computed.

3. Lvalues

a. The parser admits some syntactic "lvalues" (like declared constnat
   labels) that aren't actual lvalues.  Only variables and indexed
   expressions can be lvalues.

b. The LHS of a SET expression must be an lvalue.  The operand of an
   INCR or DECR expression must be an lvalue.

4. In an expression statement, the expression
   must have an effect, i.e., be SET, CALL, INCR, or DECR.  This
   simple check traps the nasty error of writing X=2; (comparison)
   when you meant SET X=2; (assignment).

5. At function calls, the number of args must match the number of
   params.

6. ADRESS declarations must be one-or two-byte values.  Successive
   ADDRESS declarations must increase.

7. Only one- or two-byte values can be indexed.
