AppleCore/DOS3.3
================

This directory contains the following Apple II DOS 3.3 disk images:

1.  EXAMPLES.v2d: Object code for the programs in AppleCore/Examples,
    except for Mini Adventure, Edify, and Below the Basement.

2.  MINI.ADVENTURE.v2d: Object code for the program "Mini Adventure"
    in AppleCore/Examples/MiniAdventure.

3.  EDIFY.v2d: Object code for the program "Edify" in
    AppleCore/Examples/Edify.

4.  BTB.v2d: Object code for the program "Below the Basement" in
    AppleCore/Examples/BelowTheBasement.

5.  SHELL.EDITOR.dsk: A shell editor that's a bit nicer than the
    native Apple II one, plus older ROM images patched to work with
    the editor.  The editor resides in $D000 RAM bank 1, so it works
    seamlessly with whatever is in bank 2 (usually Applesoft or
    Integer BASIC).  Also, once installed the editor is invoked
    automatically by AppleCore programs that ask for input via
    MON.GETLN.

Please note: Only SHELL.EDITOR disk is bootable.
